UI Inspiration (Modern, Clean, Gen-Z Friendly)
Take visual & UX cues from top-tier modern tools:

🔹 Notion — clean cards, spacing, minimal look

🔸 Linear — dark/light theme toggle, keyboard-friendly

🟣 Super — pastel gradients, soft visuals

🟢 Scrimba — education-first UI, timeline-focused

UI Design Tips:
Use Tailwind CSS with:

rounded-2xl, shadow-md, bg-opacity-*

hover:scale-105 for subtle animations

framer-motion for smooth fade/slide

Default theme: clean white / neutral gray

Use emoji tags, badge chips, and linear progress bars to make it more fun
